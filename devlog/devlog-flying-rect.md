# 🎮 Devlog: Flying Rect

## 🌟 Goal

Learn basic mechanics of shapes and SFML by building a simple game where the player must avoid obstacles.

---

## 🚀 Progress

- Created the basic movement mechanics for the player-controlled cube.
- Added circular obstacles that the player must avoid.
- Implemented a scoring system that increases over time.
- Handled basic collision detection to ensure the game reacts properly when hitting an obstacle.

---

## 🫠️ Technologies Used

- C++
- SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library)
- Standard Template Library (STL) for data handling

---

## ✅ Next Steps

- Improve obstacle spawning mechanics for better difficulty scaling.
- Add a simple menu screen with "Start" and "Restart" options.
- Implement sound effects and background music.
- Polish the visuals by adding animations and better UI elements.

---

## 🎯 Reflections

- Gained a better understanding of SFML's event system and rendering pipeline.
- Improved knowledge of handling real-time input and game loop structure.
- Need to refine the collision detection system for better accuracy.
- Could work on making the codebase more modular and reusable.
