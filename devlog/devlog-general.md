### 🚀 Variable declaration

- Three way of variable declaration
- Curly brackets initialization is preferred (no narrowing)
- Parantheses initialization similar to curly brackets but it doesn't throw warning
- Assignment initialization (=) consider not safe if we must ensure the lossless accuracyi

### 🚀 Input Output

- std::cerr used for printing and error
- std::clog used for log messages
- std::cout prints output in the console
- std:cin handling space based input
